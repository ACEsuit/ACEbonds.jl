This package implements an extension of ACE.jl from atomic environments to bond environments. 

The code in this package was originally developed by Liwei Zhang, Matthias Sachs and Christoph Ortner as part of ACE.jl, and has now been separated out into a separate package. It was originally released under ASL license, and is here re-released under MIT license.
